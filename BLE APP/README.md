BLE APP

How to get started?

In order to run the app on iPhone, the user must have an apple developer account (free to create), it is a general requirement for any ios development. Connect iphone to Mac using a charge cable to download the app.

Firstly, click the clone or download button on the top right, then select “Download ZIP”.

Secondly, decompress the zip file to get a folder named 3rd-Year-Group-Project-master, there is one subfolder called BLE APP, which contains the ios App as a project.

Finally Drag the whole subfolder to Xcode and choose option ‘open’, it is the easiest way to set it up, otherwise the user need to copy and paste each file, which is not recommended.
